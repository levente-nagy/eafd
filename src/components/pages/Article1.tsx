          Every home gets dirty. There are multiple ways to manage cleaning it
          but the purpose of the article is just to list the simplest steps to
          stay on top of this task.
          <br />
          <br />
          Please remember: if you clean more often, it will be easier and
          faster; if you let everything piling up, the task will be similar with
          Hercule’s struggles.
          <br />
          <br />
          This being said, let’s begin.
        </div>
        <br /> <br />
        <h5>Declutter</h5>
        <div className="subarticle">
          <img src="/Articol 1.1.jpg" className="article_photo" />
          Before starting anything else, take your time and pick up all the
          clutter. Organize all items in the designated place (if you don’t have
          one, it’s a good idea to start defining a clear place in the house for
          every category). Collect all clothes and get them to washing basket/
          machine. Set all books, documents in organized piles. Pick used plates
          and store them in kitchen sink. Store shoes in one place.
          <br />
          <br />
          Tip: if you do it daily, even you don’t take the next steps, your life
          will be much simpler, without panic attacks when you need to find
          something fast.
        </div>
        <br /> <br />
        <br />
        <h5>Face the omnipresent dust like you mean it</h5>
        <div className="subarticle">
          <br />
          <img src="/Articol 1.2.jpg" className="article_photo" />
          Start cleaning from top. Either to gather the cobwebs, either you
          dust, every time start from top. Otherwise, if you reach to an upper
          spot after cleaning below it, you risk to get things dropping and
          messing with your work.
          <br />
          <br />
          Keep in mind that some items in your house are magnets for dust and
          even is not visible till is too late, preferably you take care of
          cleaning them on a routinely basis:
          <br />
          <br />
          - All electronics;
          <br />
          - All flat surfaces, including vertical ones;
          <br />
          - Books and other paper items;
          <br />
          - Household appliances;
          <br />- Mattresses.
        </div>
        <br /> <br />
        <br />
        <h5>Vacuum/ sweep floors</h5>
        <div className="subarticle">
          <img src="/Articol 1.3.jpg" className="article_photo" />
          Use your broom to clean hard surfaces. (no, is not for Harry Potter
          only!) Take care to sweep also under furniture. Start from one corner
          and set a direction in such a way to be sure you cover complete room.
          No special advice here, just keep in mind to use soft movements (you
          are not playing cricket), otherwise all dirt will be thrown out thru
          the room and the purpose is to collect it.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you use the vacuum, same advices apply. Even if seems boring, read
          instruction before first use, to prevent headaches caused by improper
          usage.
        </div>
        <br /> <br />
        <br />
        <h5>Mop</h5>
        <div className="subarticle">
          <br />
          <img src="/Articol 1.4.jpg" className="article_photo" />
          Same like for cleaning windows, all people you know will have a
          different advice for what item to use when mopping. Stay in the middle
          range of price and you’ll be good.
          <br />
          Set a direction to be sure that you mop all surface, but take care
          that at the end of the direction you are near to room exist, otherwise
          you’ll be a prisoner till the floor gets dry. Rinse the mop frequently
          while using it.
        </div>
        <br /> <br />
        <br />
        <h5>Clean windows and mirrors</h5>
        <div className="subarticle">
          <br />
          <img src="/Articol 1.5.jpg" className="article_photo" />
          Use one damp moist cloth, followed by one dry cloth, to wipe clean all
          the mirrors and glass surfaces.
          <br />
          Every person you know will have a different advice for the substance
          for the moist cloth but from personal experience I can tell you that
          everything that is design for cleaning windows has the same results:
          from gramma’s vinegar to the most expensive you can find.
          <br />
          <br />
          Don’t forget to wash/ clean you cleaning tools and to store them to a
          dedicated space
