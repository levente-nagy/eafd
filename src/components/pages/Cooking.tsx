        <h5>Eggs</h5>
        <div className="subarticle">Eggs: good, nutritive, can be prepared in few simple ways.</div>
        <br/>

          <i>Boiled eggs</i>: are great food and can be used  also in sandwiches and chopped up on salads . The trick to great boiled eggs is not over-cooking them, which can leave a grey ring around the yolk and make their texture a bit rubbery. <br/>
          <ol type="I">
  <li>Place your eggs in a single layer on the bottom of your pot and cover with cold water. Cover the pot with a lid.</li>
  <li>Over high heat, bring your eggs to a rolling boil.</li>
  <li>Remove from heat and let stand in water for 4-6 minutes for soft boiled eggs and up to 10-12 minutes for hard boiled. Timing is defined for large eggs. Reduce the time slightly for smaller eggs, and increase the standing time for extra-large eggs.</li>
  <li>Drain water and immediately run cold water over eggs until cooled. Rapid cooling helps prevent a green ring from forming around the yolks.</li>
</ol>

          <i>Fried eggs</i>:  are a quick weekday breakfast option and can be topped on almost anything. <br/>
          <ol type="I">
  <li>Spray small non-stick skillet with oil and heat it over medium heat.</li>
  <li>Break eggs into frying pan. Cook until done as desired:
<ul>
    <li>For sunny side up, cook just until whites are set.</li>
    <li>For over-easy, cook until whites are set. Turn over and cook just long enough for a white film to form over yolks, about 30 seconds.</li>
    <li>For over well, cook until whites are set. Turn eggs over and cook until eggs are completely set, about 1 minute.</li>
</ul>
  </li>
  <li>Transfer plated to a plate with yolk up.</li>
</ol>

<i>Scrambled eggs</i>: Making scrambled eggs isn’t complicated. A bit of salt and pepper for flavor, a little butter to cook, and fresh eggs is all you need for a perfect breakfast. You can modify this recipe to include your favorite ingredients such as cheese, salsa, vegetables, and herbs. <br/>
<ol type="I">
  <li>Break eggs in a small bowl and whisk with salt and pepper. Melt butter in non-stick skillet over medium heat.</li>
  <li>Pour in egg mixture and reduce heat to medium-low. As eggs begin to set, gently move spatula across bottom and side of skillet to form large, soft curds.</li>
  <li>Cook until eggs are thickened and no visible liquid egg remains, but the eggs are not dry.</li>
</ol>

        <h5>Potatoes</h5>
        <div className="subarticle">Potatoes: beside having a great nutritional value, packed with minerals and vitamins, potatoes are base for a lot of popular recipes.</div>
        <div className="subarticle">
          <img src="/Cooking2_boiled.jpg" className="article_photo" />
          <div className='sub_text'>
          <i>Boiled potatoes</i>: good to know, because you’ll need them for mashed potatoes, potato salad or just to eat them simple, with some salt, pepper and a bit of melted butter.<br/>
          <ol type="I">
  <li>Prepare potatoes. Scrub potatoes clean using a vegetable/ soft scrubber. You can also peal and cut your potatoes into smaller pieces depending on what you're making. You can leave the skin on or peel it depending on personal preference. Some argue that leaving the skin on helps the potatoes hold their shape while boiling.</li>
  <li>Transfer and cover. Transfer potatoes to a pot. Cover with cold water and add ½ teaspoon of salt.</li>
  <li>Simmer potatoes. Bring the water to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover the pot with a lid and let simmer until fork-tender, about 10 to 15 minutes for small and/or cubed potatoes or 20 to 25 minutes for large potatoes.</li>
  <li>Drain and cool. Drain potatoes in a colander. To rapidly cool potatoes for recipes that call for cooled potatoes, you can submerge them in an ice bath.</li>
</ol>

          <i>Fried potatoes</i>: I think you don’t need any indications about their usage.<br/>
          <ol type="I">
  <li>Prepare potatoes. Peal and slice your potatoes.</li>
  <li>Medium heat 3-4 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a frying pan until shimmering.</li>
  <li>Add potatoes into one single layer. You also can salt them now. Don’t add other seasoning in this moment, because can burn. Cover with lid.</li>
  <li>Until 10 to 20 minutes- depending on the size of potatoes, the bottom should be golden- brown. You can flip them now on the other side.</li>
  <li>Increase the heat to medium high, add salt and pepper and cook them for 5 to 10 minutes uncovered. ( again, depends on size of cut pieces and you need to check for golden- brown color at the bottom)</li>
  <li>Now you can add extra seasoning like herbs and a tablespoon of butter if you want. Keep them cooking for 1 minute while stirring and that’s it. </li>
</ol>

          <div className='sub_text'>
          Pasta: we love pastas. It’s coming in a great palette of shapes and can be combined with almost everything so, let’s learn how to cook it. <br/>
          <ol type="I">
  <li>Choose your vessel: you can cook pasta in almost anything, but keep in mind that :
<ul>
    <li>You’ll need a pot with enough volume for needed amount of water( 0.5 to 1 liter of water per each 100 grams of pasta- according with supplier instructions).</li>
    <li>If you cook long pastas, like spaghetti, it’s preferable to have a deep pot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
  <li>Over high heat, bring the water to boil; if you cover the pot, it will boil faster. Salt the water ( 1 tablespoon of salt at 4 liters of water is fine) after is boiling.</li>
  <li>Add pasta and stir the water in the first minute after.
    <ul>
        <li>Don’t add pasta until water is boiling, otherwise, you’ll get mushy one.</li>
        <li>Stir at the beginning to avoid it stick together.</li>
    </ul>
     </li>
  <li>Taste your pasta after half of the boiling time indicated by supplier passed. The time can vary based on size and freshness of pasta and you want to avoid over cooking.</li>
</ol>
Tip: Reserve some water before you drain.  All the starch that your noodles released into the water will help thicken any sauce you make to dress the noodles. Plus, it will be a little salty, so it adds flavor to homemade sauces as well.
