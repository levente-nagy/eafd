            The essential thing you can do to keep your devices running smoothly is to keep your software up to date. It includes the operating system, applications, and other programs.
            <br /> <br />
            The regular updates mainly contain bug fixes, security patches, and new features that can enhance your experience. Some devices will automatically update, but it is not a good idea to check for updates regularly.

          <h5>Use strong passwords</h5>

            With the help of strong and unique passwords, you can protect your online accounts from hackers and other security threats. Avoid using guessable passwords such as 12345 and use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
 <br/><br/>
 Additionally, avoid using the same password across multiple accounts. If you find it difficult to remember, then make sure to use the password manager to help you securely store and manage the passwords.

          <h5>Stay safe online</h5>
          <div className="subarticle">
            <img src="/Tech3.jpg" className="article_photo" />
            Staying safe online is essential to protect yourself from cyber threats such as malware, phishing scams, and identity theft. Make sure to use antivirus software to safeguard the device from different viruses and other threats.

          <h5>Always backup your data</h5>

            Backing up your data is vital to avoid losing essential files and documents in the event of a device failure. There are different ways to back up your data, including the external hard drive, cloud storage, or backup software.
 <br/><br/>
 Use caution while opening attachments or accessing links from unidentified sources. When itâ€™s feasible, utilize two-factor authentication and stay away from revealing personal information online. With two-factor authentication, your accounts are further secured by requiring a second form of identity, such as a fingerprint scan or text message.
