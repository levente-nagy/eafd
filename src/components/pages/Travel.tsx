          <h5>Carry a hotel card</h5>
          <div className="subarticle">

            Make sure you always have a hotel card in your wallet or pocket before heading out. We’re all so used to using Google Maps and our phones that it’s easy to forget where our hotel is or even what it’s called. Your phone might run out of battery or you might lose it, leaving you stranded. If you can’t communicate with the locals, your situation could get worse. Hotel business cards never run out of battery and can save the day.

          <h5>Get universally powered</h5>

            Great for connecting your computer, phone, tablet, and whatever else you need to the local power without worrying about buying a converter in every country.
            <br/><br/>
Although these universal power adaptors change to suit many countries, it’s worth having a single country (or group of countries) adaptor too, just in case. Universal adaptors have a habit of breaking (thanks to the moving parts) and single country adaptors are cheap and lightweight so why not carry an extra one or two?

          <h5>Water bottle upgrade</h5>
          <div className="subarticle">
            <img src="/Travel3.jpg" className="article_photo" />
            An upgrade from a plastic water bottle is an insulated metal bottle. Yes, you can carry a stainless steel water bottle on a plane.<br/><br/>
I like to carry a thick metal water bottle or thermos to serve two purposes (or more). One, I can store water and hot beverages in it. And two, it makes a great stand-in as a foam roller for massaging away knots in your muscles after long-haul travel. I’ll admit that it’s a very solid foam roller. But I prefer that. If you’d like something that inflicts a little less pain, try wrapping a towel around the water bottle.

          <h5>Learn the lingo</h5>

            Always learn a few local words to make your travel experience much more rewarding and less stressful.
            <br/><br/>
The doors that have opened for me from learning a few words of the local language are huge and wide. I’ve managed to get myself out of tricky situations (many of which I’m too embarrassed to share), get directions, and obtain the correct bus ticket in some foreign land. Because I learned a few words and phrases, like “how much?”, “Where is…?”, “bakery”, “bus station”.
<br/><br/>
I can’t overstate how important this is. It could be one of the best travel hacks in your toolbox.

          <h5>Save money on hotels</h5>

            Rate Punk is a travel-hacking Chrome web browser extension that shows you the wholesale prices on hotels that only the corporate travel websites have access to. I also recommend joining hotel loyalty programs like Hilton Honors for the special offers and deals that other services can’t match. It’s free, so why not?<br/><br/>
Keep in mind that if you’re booking your hotels through a portal like Turkish Airlines or British Airways (Avios), these Chrome extensions may interfere with registering the points to your account. If in doubt, use a different browser to search with these plugins.

            Pack at least one set of clothes into your carry on bag. If the airline loses your bags you can sometimes expect a few days to get them back. The last thing you want on the first days of your trip is to go shopping for clothes. Or maybe you enjoy that kind of thing. In that case, ignore this advice.
